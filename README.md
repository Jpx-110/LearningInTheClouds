# LearningInTheClouds
A Repository to document my learning and development in Cloud Computing and DevOps

# Welcome 
I will be using this repository to document my learning experience during this fun but challenging journey. I use Notion for my personal notetaking but I thought it would be a great idea to share my notes and project work with the wider community using Guthub. I have included a high level roadmap for my journey to keep me organised and help me stay consistent with my learning.

# Cloud Roadmap
1. Networking Fundamentals
2. CLI & Linux Fundamentals
3. Bash Scripting
4. Programming Language - Python
5. Version Control - Git
6. AWS Fundamentals - CCP
7. Infrastructure as Code - Terraform/CloudFormation
